// Open Box
// An open box is made from a piece of rectangular cardboard by cutting out squares of equal size
// from the four corners and bending up the sides. What size should the squares be to obtain a box
// with the largest possible volume? The length and width of the cardboard are given by the user.
// Write a C++ program that uses a function-driven style to solve this problem (3 points off for not
// using the style). Allow your program to run again and again as often as the user wishes (3 points
// off for not allowing the repetition). Validate your input values to detect characters and negative
// values, which should be discarded. Finally, and a must-have requirement, have your name as the
// programmer who wrote the program in the output.
// With a function-driven program, the main function will contain only function calls, to call all
// other functions. Variable declarations are allowed in the main function; nothing else is
// allowed.
// For example, testing data,
// • For the entered sides 16 and 30 of the cardboard, the size of the cut is 3.33 and the
// maximum volume of the box is 725.93
// • For the entered sides 20 and 16 of the cardboard, the size of the cut is 2.95 and the
// maximum volume of the box is 420.11
// Note: For a rectangle, we cannot say the length must be larger than (or smaller than) the width.
// There is no need to use calculus. If you think that calculus is required, you're in the wrong
// way.
// Requirement: The output should contain the following sentences:
// The given length of the cardboard: 20
// The given width of the cardboard: 16
// The maximum volume of the opened box: 420.11
// The size of the cut: 2.95
// Run the program again (y/n)? n
// Programmer: That is Me.
